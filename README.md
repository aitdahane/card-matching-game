# Flip Card Project
In this repo, you will find the source code of the Flippy Square game.

Flippy Square is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards before the time ended. It is a particularly good game for young children, though adults may find it challenging and stimulating as well.

You can download it from the play store using the following link:
